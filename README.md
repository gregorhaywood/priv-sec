# Privacy and Security for Everyone

Threats to privacy and security are, unfortunatly, an 
inescapable reality of the world we find ourselves in.
Various resources and guides exist to help with that,
but all face various flaws: some are outdated; some
are inaccessibly technical; others make unreasonable
demands on usability.

The purpose of these guides is to provide an effective,
accessibly way for you to boost your security, and boost
your *confidence* in your security. The guide is organised
into **Action Plans** and **Deep Dives**. Action Plans
are checklists and instructions that tell you what to do to
up your security game. Deep Dives provide additional content
and explinations about *why* you should follow the Action
Plan.

## Privacy *and* Security?

**Security** generally refers to protections against illegitimate
access to and abuse of resources (email, banking, etc.), while
**Privacy** attacks relate to the illegitimate use of information.
In many cases, these can be considered seperatly, however there
are overlaps. A security breach can easily be turned into a privacy
compromise by accessing personal data; a privacy compromise can
enable a security breach through convincing phishing, compromising
security questions, or otherwise facilitating fraud. In Deep
Dives, I'll strive to be clear about *why* countermeasures are
necessary, but for convinience I will not distinguish between privacy
and security in Action Plans.

## Golden Rules

In all cases, there a few general principles that always hold.

### Safety is a Lie

There is nothing anyone can do to guarantee security. Just as you cannot
guarantee no-one will steal your car, you cannot prevent security breaches
with certainty. It will happen to you again. It will happen to me again.
This guide will make it *harder*, not impossible. When the inevitable happens,
remember that you have not failed. Pursue whatever recovery mechanisms you
need, update passwords, and carry on free of shame.

### You are the Boss

Safety requires compromise. You cannot access the same degree of functionality
with the same degree of ease while also improving security. The measures I
describe are what I judge to be a safe **minimum** -- there are a multitude
of additional measures one could take, but doing so requires additional
compromises to useability. That said, even these measures will be inconvinient
and frustrating at times. I believe they are wise steps to take, but I cannot
make that decision for you. If you decide the extra effort these measures
require is too much, you do not have to do them! Ultimatly, all security is a
compromise, so if convinience is more important to you, you can compromise in
that direction.

### Your Boss is the Boss

Your employers should have their own security policies -- follow those with
your work accounts. It is good practice to keep personal and work accounts
seperate: do that! Keep these guides for your personal accounts. If advice I
give conflicts with your employer, speak to your security person. The purpose
of their role should be to enable you to do your job safely, so they should be
keen to answer these questions.

## Living Document

When I have capacity, I will update this repository with more
Action Plans and Deep Dives. When there are significant changes,
I will make a note in the CHANGELOG file -- especially if the
changes include a revision of earlier advice.
